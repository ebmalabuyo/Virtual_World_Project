Questions:
1 - 2) There is ultimately TWO world events that can be triggered in the game.
First, by clicking the mouse on an open spot, a web portal will spawn animating
a web background on surrounding tiles which spawns more Spider Eggs.
This allows Spiders to spawn which changes the behavior of the Dude Entities
from this world event. Second, another world event is triggered by the player
when clicking shift as this spawns more food on the tile to the right and affects the behavior of the Spiders.

Another feature is the player can destroy the spiders to the right of its position with the CTRL button.

3) The effected entities from the world events are the Dudes that destroy the spiders and the Spiders that try to get the food.
Both the Dude and Spiders are effected as their pathing algorithm will account for the spawned entities and change their target.

4) There are two new entities that come from the world event. A portal will be added with the portal bringing in Spider eggs at a faster action period.
